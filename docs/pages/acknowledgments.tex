%TODO: Acknowledgments
Firstly I would like to thank my advisor Katharina Kreuzer, for initially accepting my proposal for this project in the practical course and going all the way to the end of this thesis with me. She introduced me to cryptographic proofs and specifically game-based proofs, which now form a core part of this work.
I also want to thank her for her quick responses and the time spent with me thinking about the caveats of proofs I did not fully understand. 

Additionally, I also want to thank Prof. Ian Goldberg, author of the KZG, for his swift responses and intuitive explanations. 

Lastly, I want to thank Prof. Tobias Nipkow for allowing me to continue the project from a practical course in this thesis.
