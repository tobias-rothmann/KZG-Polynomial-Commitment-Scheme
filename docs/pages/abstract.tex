We formalize security properties for the polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) by Kate, Zaverucha, and Goldberg (KZG) in the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. A PCS is a cryptographic primitive that is commonly used in modern cryptography, namely in \textit{succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge} (SNARKs). 
Building on our work in the practical course, where we formalized \textit{correctness} and the security property \textit{polynomial binding}, we complete the common security properties for polynomial commitment schemes. We formally prove \textit{hiding, evaluation binding}, and, additionally, the property of \textit{knowledge soundness}, which is commonly required for SNARK constructions.
Furthermore, we extend our formalization to a batched version of the KZG for which we prove \textit{evaluation binding} and \textit{knowledge soundness} formally and discuss the \textit{hiding} proof.
We provide our proofs in a game-based manner instead of the original reduction-style argument to strengthen trust in their security.
This is the first formalization of any polynomial commitment scheme, to our knowledge.
